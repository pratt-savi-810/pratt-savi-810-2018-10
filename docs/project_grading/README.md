# Final Project 

Your final project is the only thing you'll be evaluated on. 

1. **Code Successfully Runs** (33.3%)
    * Self contained-can run on course instructor(s) machine, either provide download links or auto-download. (Entire 33.3% of this portion of the code.)
    * Screen recording of code in action, either [Recordit.app](http://recordit.co/) or to YouTube. 
    * If your code does not run, you'll have 1 week from Instructor testing to refactor/repair. 

2. **Code Readability** (33.3%)
    * No PEP-8 issues (when PyCharm shows red or yellow warnings) (11.1%)
        * Exceptions being for `arcpy.mapping`, `arcpy.search`, `arcpy.da`, etc. 
    * Functional `def some_function()` rather than linear scripting (11.1%)
    * Do not include file names inside functions (11.1%), pass them as variables.
    * Bonus 10+ points for using a `config.json` or commandline arguments. 
    * If your code has readability issues, you'll have 1 week from Instructor testing to refactor/repair. 
    
3. **Documentation** (33.3%)
    * Documentation will be in your project's README.md file.
        * Description (11.1%)
        * Outline (pseudo code or outline of steps) (11.1%)
        * **Required**: **Screen recording of code in action**, either [Recordit.app](http://recordit.co/) or to YouTube. (11.1%)
